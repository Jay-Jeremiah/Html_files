    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Harry Jay Jeremiah is a young man who is still walking his journey of education. He has been venturing the world of computing devices and technology.
        In his young life, he developed the zeal to be around computers or someone would call it being addicted to a computing device. The mistake his parents 
        did was to put a phone and a computer infront of his face. That sparked off his adventure into the world of computing devices and he actually grew
        fond of these tools to the extent that whenever they would get a problem, he always wanted to be one to fix them on his own.

        With such enthusiasm, he looked for all the ways to be updated about the trending technologies and devices. He later realised that knowing about the tecnologies
        and devices wouldn't just be enough. Harry became interested in the how the different devices are developed and how they perform as they do. While digging deep 
        into the matter, he found out that it involves many other hidden processes which include the following:
        <ul>
            <li>System Administration</li>
            <li>Database Management</li>
            <li>Programming</li>
            <li>Command-Line Interface interaction</li>
            <li>and many others</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

        Seeing that his desired future was being lightened up and involves many processes, he decided to find out which of the proceses was he most interested in for him to
        to reach his ultimate goal. Over the years, he has had time to himself but he has not yet found the right one but he has his eyes on the command line interface and 
        programming necause decision making is not easy especially in the youthful age. <i>"I am always fascinated by many people use the command line and I like seeing the 
        different code structures."</i>said Harry. This actually leads us to where he is at this point. He is taking on a mantle to equip himself with the necessary skills to
        be one of the greatest command line users and have the best program structure the world has ever seen. <strong>Where there is a will, there is always a way.</strong>
        Never know Harry is going to the next big deal in the world of tech.
